## DO NOT EDIT THIS FILE, IT IS A TEMPLATE. THAT YOU NEED TO COPY
# Prusa MK3s Klipper Config

# The first thing you'll need to do is go through this file and comment out / uncomment
# the files and/or settings you need.

# You'll be able to print just fine with this config as it is, but it is recommended
# that you follow these steps to properly calibrate your printer:

# 0) Sanity check and PID Tuning: https://www.klipper3d.org/Config_checks.html
# 1) Pressure Advance: https://www.klipper3d.org/Pressure_Advance.html
# 2) Skew Correction: https://www.klipper3d.org/skew_correction.html
# 3) Resonance Compensation: https://www.klipper3d.org/Resonance_Compensation.html

### EXTRUSION

# Extruder
[include klipper-prusa-mk3s/extruders/prusa.cfg]
# [include klipper-prusa-mk3s/extruders/bmg.cfg]

# Hotend
[include klipper-prusa-mk3s/hotends/v6.cfg]

# [include klipper-prusa-mk3s/hotends/rapido.cfg]

[extruder]
# To tune Pressure Advance see https://www.klipper3d.org/Pressure_Advance.html
# default is already set based on hotend, but you can further improve prints by calibrating it to your nozzle and material
# pressure_advance: 0.05
control: pid
nozzle_diameter: 0.4 # Remember to change this if you change nozzle diameter.
pid_Kp: 23.862
pid_Ki: 1.020
pid_Kd: 139.595

## copy this from your current setting on Prusa, but make it absolute (removing -)
# [probe]
# z_offset = 0.685

## For faster printing enable
# [printer]
# max_accel: 2000
# max_accel_to_decel: 2000
# max_z_velocity: 20
# max_z_accel: 300

## For stealth mode enable

# [tmc2130 stepper_x]
# interpolate: True
# stealthchop_threshold: 80
# [tmc2130 stepper_y]
# interpolate: True
# stealthchop_threshold: 80
# [tmc2130 stepper_z]
# interpolate: True
# stealthchop_threshold: 80

## Custom bed mest probes
## Prusa has 3x3 or 7x7, you can do any variation you want
# [bed_mesh]
# probe_count: 4,4

# Linear correction
# Check `extruders/linear-correction` for more informations.
[include klipper-prusa-mk3s/extruders/linear-correction/linear-correction-0.cfg] # Default Prusa linear correction optimized for LDO motors

### MACROS
[include klipper-prusa-mk3s/macros.cfg]

# FIRST RUN: 
# Execute these sequentially in the console, let PID tuning finish before saving
# PID_CALIBRATE HEATER=extruder TARGET=170
# SAVE_CONFIG
# PID_CALIBRATE HEATER=heater_bed TARGET=60
# SAVE_CONFIG

# You can also skip the above setting for stock Prusa and use
# min_temp: 0
# max_temp: 305
# min_extrude_temp: 170


### The end, on the end the printer will store it's tuning data, so do not edit it.
